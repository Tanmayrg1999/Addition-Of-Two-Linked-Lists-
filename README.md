# Addition-Of-Two-Linked-Lists-
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contain a single digit. We need to Add the two numbers and return it.<br>
Input: (7 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)<br>
Output: 7 -> 8 -> 0 -> 7<br
To declare two linked list we can use 2 head pointers that point to the start of two Linked List and then we can add it arithmetically.
